## Notes on Usage

- The `00-Index` folder serves as the entry point to your vault. Use it to create main MOC (Map of Content) files that link to other areas of your vault.

- The `01-Linux` folder is structured to cover various aspects of Linux. Adjust subfolders as needed based on your focus areas.

- Use the `02-Projects` folder to manage your projects. Move projects between subfolders as their status changes.

- `03-Quick-Notes` is for rapid capture. Regularly process these notes and move them to appropriate locations in your vault.

- Personalize the `04-Personal` and `05-Work` folders based on your specific needs and workflows.

- Use the `06-Resources` folder to store notes on external content you've consumed or tools you use.

- The `07-Archive` folder helps keep your active folders clean without losing old information.

- Store all non-markdown files in the `Assets` folder for better organization.

- Create and store your note templates in the `Templates` folder for easy access when creating new notes.

Remember to use tags, backlinks, and Obsidian's powerful search feature to navigate your vault effectively. This structure is a starting point - feel free to adjust it as you use your vault and discover your optimal workflow.
