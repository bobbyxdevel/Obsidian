I've been redoing my whole digital life. Everything is getting refiled. 

Heres my method for everything digital now (hard drives, phone, notion, obsidian, cloud drives... everything) its been working well:


**Home dir**


**_work**

---documents

---recipts and invoices

---photos

---resources



**-personal**

---documents

---writing

---photos and videos



**-Archive**

--- (here i have the entire directory again to organize old things)



**-library**

---books

---audio

---video

---Research papers

---articles

---manuals and guides




**-Creative**

---current projects 

--- art

---clip art and design assets

---inspiriation

---writing 



**-to organize**



**-trash**




Things are further organized, but this is the main directory.
